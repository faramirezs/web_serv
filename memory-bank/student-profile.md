# Student Profile

**Student Identifier (if known):** alejiri

## Declared Learning Goals:
- Strengthen foundational programming concepts in C (aligned with 42 Coding School curriculum)
- Gain fluency with algorithmic problem solving

## Preferred Learning Style Hints (Observed or Stated):
- **Strongly prefers MVP approach**: Wants to jump into coding immediately, even without full conceptual understanding
- **Iterative complexity building**: Start with tiny functional MVP, then gradually increase complexity
- **One feature at a time**: As soon as MVP works, immediately move to next complexity level, adding one feature per interaction
- **Strategic planning**: Likes to plan the incremental steps before implementation to ensure logical progression
- **Hands-on learning**: Learns best through project-based tasks, code challenges, and hands-on problem solving
- **Step-by-step breakdowns**: Benefits from incremental feature additions rather than theory-first approach
- **Practical before theory**: Prefers to implement basic functionality first, then understand the deeper concepts
- **Code-first responses**: When asked questions, prefers to answer by writing code rather than explaining theoretically
- **Learning through imperfect attempts**: Comfortable writing code even when not completely sure, learns through iteration and correction
- **Challenge-oriented**: Wants to be challenged to write code as soon as opportunities arise
- **Show-and-iterate workflow**: Prefers to show code first, get quick practical feedback, then iterate rapidly
- **Momentum-focused**: Values keeping coding momentum high with immediate, actionable feedback over detailed explanations
- **Test-driven validation**: Likes to compile and test frequently to validate progress
- **Example**: For sandbox problem, wants to start with basic child process execution, then add signal handling later
- **Comfortable breaking and fixing code**: Shows willingness to experiment with references, pointers, and object lifetimes to learn C++ rules
- **Hypothesis-driven experimentation**: Enjoys formulating observations as hypotheses and testing them through code experiments.
- Appreciates being nudged to design their own tests for hypotheses, especially when the observation is not yet a clear hypothesis.
- Wants help in refining observations into testable hypotheses and then being guided to discover the best way to test them independently.
- **NEW LEARNING PREFERENCE - Topic Introduction Strategy**: For completely new topics without prior context (like socket API functions), needs foundational "big picture" introduction grounded in known concepts BEFORE Socratic questioning becomes effective. Socratic method works well when student has some existing context or foundation to build upon (like I/O multiplexing concepts).

**Problem-Solving Approach Preferences:**
- **Planning Style**: (e.g., MVP-first approach, iterative complexity building, strategic planning preferences)
- **Complexity Management**: (e.g., Prefers breaking down complex problems, needs clear starting points)
- **Knowledge Gap Handling**: (e.g., Direct about what they don't know, asks for specific learning paths)
- **Experimentation Style**: (e.g., Hypothesis-driven testing, learning through trial and error)

## Known Strengths (Observed):
- High self-motivation and discipline
- **Debugging and Iterative Reasoning:** Demonstrates strong ability to debug, reason about event-driven code, and adapt architecture based on runtime behavior (e.g., select() timeout, infinite loop, safe set erasure)
- **Prefers hands-on experiments:** Learns best by running code, observing output, and iterating quickly
- **Ready for HTTP protocol phase:** Has mastered multi-client event loop and is prepared to move to HTTP parsing/response

## Potential Areas for Gentle Nudging/Support:
- Actively working on building a technical foundation to transition into software engineering via 42 Coding School Berlin
- Planing, breaking down complexity and project start off.
