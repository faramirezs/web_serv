# Active Session Context

**Session Date:** 2025-07-23 (ISO 8601 format: YYYY-MM-DD)
**Student Identifier:** alejiri

## Current Problem/Topic Focus:
- **Topic:** Webserv HTTP Server Implementation - select() Integration
- **Specific Issue:** Transitioning from echo server MVP to select()-based multi-client handling
- **Related Plan:** MVP completed (echo server), now implementing select() for non-blocking I/O
- **Plan Step:** Understanding select() function parameters and preparing for implementation

## Current Code Under Review:
```cpp
// Echo server MVP completed in main.cpp
// Basic socket(), bind(), listen(), accept(), recv(), send() flow working
// Current file: main.cpp with functional echo server
// Next: Integrate select() for multiple client handling
```

## Student's Current Question/Blocker:
- Just received foundational explanation of select() function and parameters
- Has working echo server that handles one connection
- Understanding file descriptors to monitor: serverSocket for new connections, clientSocket(s) for data
- Ready to implement select() integration

## Key Points from Last Exchange:
- Successfully completed echo server MVP using basic socket API
- Received foundational explanation of select() prototype and parameters
- Understands fd_set operations: FD_ZERO, FD_SET, FD_CLR, FD_ISSET
- Grasps that select() monitors multiple file descriptors for readiness
- Identified need to monitor serverSocket (new connections) and clientSocket(s) (existing client data)

## Next Socratic Question/Guidance Plan:
- **Planned Question:** "Looking at your echo server, what file descriptors do you need to monitor with select()?"
- **Reasoning:** Apply select() knowledge to current code structure
- **Backup Approaches:** Guide through server loop redesign, fd_set setup, or select() return value handling
- **Plan Alignment:** Transform single-client echo server into multi-client select()-based server

## Session Notes:
- Student is ready for advanced systems programming after C++ module completion
- Need to leverage existing C++ knowledge for network programming
- Focus on non-blocking I/O, HTTP protocol, and server architecture
- Student shows strong problem-solving skills from previous modules
